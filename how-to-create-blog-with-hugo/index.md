# Build Your Own Blog Website in 10 Minutes

## What is Hugo

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. Users can quickly build their own websites using Hugo.

## Setup Steps

### Install Hugo
On a Mac, you can use the following command to install Hugo:
```bash
brew install hugo
```
![install](https://img.music-poster.art/2025/05/c9d27037a7d215ff8eaa14383cba62b6.png)

After installation, you can check if it's installed properly using `hugo version`:

### Create a Blog Website with Hugo
Once Hugo is installed, you can use it to create your own blog website.
Use `hugo new site my-blog` to create a site named my-blog.
![new-blog-site](https://img.music-poster.art/2025/05/c31b6d2f942a44af304823b9b2d40e76.png)
After running this command, a directory named my-blog will be created in the current directory.
Then, navigate into that directory and initialize it with git.
```bash
cd my-blog
git init
```

### Choose a Theme
After creating the website, you need to choose a theme. There are many themes available for selection: [hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
Here, I am choosing the hugo-theme-even theme. At this point, it needs to be added as a submodule under themes/even.
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even.git themes/even
```
![pick-theme](https://img.music-poster.art/2025/05/10d92ec7695324dd4db2cb0772f764f8.png)
After that, copy `themes/even/exampleSite/config.toml` to the current directory and overwrite `hugo.toml`
```bash
cp themes/even/exampleSite/config.toml hugo.toml
```

### Create a Blog Post
Once the theme is configured, you can create your own blog post.
Use `hugo new content/content/post/my-first-post.md` to create a blog post.
You can see that a new md file will appear under `content/post/` after executing this command.

### Run Hugo
Once the previous configurations are done, you can start a Hugo server using `hugo server`.

Click the link to access the blog website address.

At this point, you will notice that the previously created blog does not appear; the reason is that the blog created earlier is set as `draft`, and it will not be displayed in `hugo server` mode.
To show it, you need to use `hugo server -D`.

With this, you can complete the setup of your blog website.

### Save the Local Blog to GitHub
* Log in to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., heyjude-blog).
* Add the local repository as a remote:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/myblog.git
git push
```
This way, you can save your blog to GitHub.
